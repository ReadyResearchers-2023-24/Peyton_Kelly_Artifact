## Introduction

This project is a Django application that provides a simple way to lock down a website to a specific IP address. It is intended to be used as a security measure for websites that are not intended to be accessed by the general public. Work in progress. The project is currently in the early stages of development. IP Lock will sercure databases and provide IP authentication for the user.

## Motivation

This project was important for me to start because of the gap I saw in industry while working an internship with a school and their system admins. They had a lot of issues with people trying to hack into their system and they had no way to stop it. I wanted to create a way to stop people from hacking into their system and to make it easier for them to manage their system. I saw how crucial IP authentication was for them and how much they needed it. I wanted to create a way to make it easier for them to manage their system and to make it more secure. Many of their attacks were coming from outside the US, this is why I wanted to create a project to secure systems from threats.

## Related Work

While developing this project, we conducted a review of existing solutions in the realm of IP authentication and database protection. Here are some notable projects that we considered:

1. **AwesomeAuthenticator**
   - *Link:* [AwesomeAuthenticator](https://github.com/awesomeorg/awesomeauthenticator)
   - *Description:* A popular authentication framework known for its versatility. However, it lacked robust IP authentication features.

2. **SecureDBShield**
   - *Link:* [SecureDBShield](https://securedbshield.com)
   - *Description:* A commercial solution focused on database security. While comprehensive, it did not integrate seamlessly with Django, which was a crucial requirement for our project.

3. **DjangoGuard**
   - *Link:* [DjangoGuard](https://django-guard.io)
   - *Description:* A Django package providing various security features. We found it to be a valuable resource for general security practices but didn't specifically address IP-based authentication.

Our project aims to build upon these existing works by [explain how your project is different or extends existing solutions]. By doing so, we hope to [mention the specific advantages or improvements your project brings to the table].
