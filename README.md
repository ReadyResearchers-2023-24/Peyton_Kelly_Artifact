## Introduction

This project is a Django application that provides a simple way to lock down a website to a specific IP address. It is intended to be used as a security measure for websites that are not intended to be accessed by the general public. Work in progress. The project is currently in the early stages of development. IP Lock will secure databases and provide IP authentication for the user.

## Motivation

This project was important for me to start because of the gap I saw in the industry while working an internship with a school and its system admins. They had a lot of issues with people trying to hack into their system and they had no way to stop it. I wanted to create a way to stop people from hacking into their systems and to make it easier for them to manage their systems. I saw how crucial IP authentication was for them and how much they needed it. I wanted to create a way to make it easier for them to manage their system and to make it more secure. Many of their attacks were coming from outside the US, this is why I wanted to create a project to secure systems from threats.

## Features

List and briefly describe the key features of your project. This can include:

- **IP Authentication:** How users' IP addresses are used for authentication.
- **Database Protection:** Measures taken to secure databases.
- **[Additional Feature 1]**

## Related Work

While developing this project, we reviewed existing solutions in the realm of IP authentication and database protection.

## Installation

Clone the repo and be in the directory UserIpProject
It can be run locally with the 'python manage.py runserver'
This will allow the site to be reached. Along with my site comes some of the code to run the geolocation service on the IP address. There are some files worth running in Python to see what will be a part of my project.
